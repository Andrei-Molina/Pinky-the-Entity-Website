                The main character of <em>Pinky The Entity</em>, Pinky is a curious and adventurous slimian from the planet Slimoroid. 
                Small in size but full of determination, he has the ability to stretch, bounce, and shift his form in ways that help him survive dangerous worlds. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite his cheerful appearance, Pinky is no ordinary slime—he carries a mysterious energy within him, one that attracts both powerful allies and relentless enemies. 
                On his journey, Pinky seeks not only to explore strange lands but also to uncover the truth behind his origins and the secret of the “Entity” that dwells inside him. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Brave, mischievous, and endlessly resilient, Pinky is the heart of the adventure—whether leaping across platforms, outsmarting rivals, or protecting those he cares about.

                <p>
                  Known only as <em>The All-Seeing Eye</em>, this strange being seems to know far more than it should. 
                  Its unblinking gaze unsettles Pinky, for it speaks of secrets—about the world, about the Entity, 
                  even about Pinky himself—that he has never known. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pinky first found it trapped in a force field after awakening from a long slumber. 
                  Yet even in captivity, the Eye did not beg for freedom—it only watched, as if it had been waiting 
                  for him all along. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ominous and cryptic, the Eye may be a guide… or something far more dangerous. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  <em>Blocky the Armless</em> is a strange figure who awoke in an unknown place with only his legs to 
                  carry him. His arms are missing, though whether by fate, design, or something darker, he cannot say. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite his odd form, Blocky is friendly and harmless—or so Pinky believes. His tough, block-like 
                  shell makes him surprisingly resilient, able to leap great heights and smash through obstacles 
                  without so much as a scratch. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though his past is a mystery, Blocky’s determination and disarming nature make him an unlikely but 
                  steadfast companion in Pinky’s journey.
