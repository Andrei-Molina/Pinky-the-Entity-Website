              <p>
                The main character of <em>Pinky The Entity</em>, Pinky is a curious and adventurous slimian from the planet Slimoroid. 
                Small in size but full of determination, he has the ability to stretch, bounce, and shift his form in ways that help him survive dangerous worlds. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite his cheerful appearance, Pinky is no ordinary slime—he carries a mysterious energy within him, one that attracts both powerful allies and relentless enemies. 
                On his journey, Pinky seeks not only to explore strange lands but also to uncover the truth behind his origins and the secret of the “Entity” that dwells inside him. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Brave, mischievous, and endlessly resilient, Pinky is the heart of the adventure—whether leaping across platforms, outsmarting rivals, or protecting those he cares about.

                  Known only as <em>The All-Seeing Eye</em>, this strange being seems to know far more than it should. 
                  Its unblinking gaze unsettles Pinky, for it speaks of secrets—about the world, about the Entity, 
                  even about Pinky himself—that he has never known. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pinky first found it trapped in a force field after awakening from a long slumber. 
                  Yet even in captivity, the Eye did not beg for freedom—it only watched, as if it had been waiting 
                  for him all along. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ominous and cryptic, the Eye may be a guide… or something far more dangerous.

                <p>
                  <em>Blocky the Armless</em> is a strange figure who awoke in an unknown place with only his legs to 
                  carry him. His arms are missing, though whether by fate, design, or something darker, he cannot say. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite his odd form, Blocky is friendly and harmless—or so Pinky believes. His tough, block-like 
                  shell makes him surprisingly resilient, able to leap great heights and smash through obstacles 
                  without so much as a scratch. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though his past is a mystery, Blocky’s determination and disarming nature make him an unlikely but 
                  steadfast companion in Pinky’s journey.

                <p>
                  <em>Robotri the Robo</em> was born of cosmic craftsmanship, yet condemned as a failure. Cast adrift 
                  into the endless void, he wandered for millennia—silent, broken, and forgotten among the stars. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Pinky found him in a barren wasteland, Robotri was little more than a husk. Only through 
                  Pinky’s mysterious power did his fading spark flicker back to life, though many of his parts remain 
                  shattered and incomplete. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Haunted by rejection and the emptiness of his long exile, Robotri follows Pinky with quiet resolve— 
                  not out of duty alone, but in the faint hope that their journey may reveal the purpose he was never 
                  meant to have.

                <p>
                  Born from a fragment of Pinky’s soul during the cataclysm of the <em>Arbitral of the Court of Cosmic 
                  Divergence</em>, <em>Green: The Envy</em> is both a reflection of Pinky and his twisted opposite. 
                  He embodies the restless hunger of envy, always yearning for what others have and never content with 
                  his own form. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  His power is as dangerous as it is insidious—he can mimic the abilities of those he faces, or twist 
                  their hearts with envy until allies turn bitter and foes grow reckless. Yet the more Pinky grows, 
                  the more Green feeds, drawing strength from what was once his other half. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jealous, cunning, and unyielding, Green is a constant shadow to Pinky’s light—a reminder that even 
                  the brightest soul carries darkness within.

                <p>
                  One of the first fragments torn from Pinky’s soul, <em>Amber: The Greed</em> embodies the insatiable 
                  urge to take and never let go. What began as Pinky’s desire to hold on to what he loved became twisted 
                  into obsession—an endless craving to claim all things for himself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  His power thrives on possession. Amber can drain the strength of others, stealing abilities and 
                  hoarding them within his core. Every victory, every treasure, every ounce of power he gathers is 
                  guarded jealously, as though the very act of owning defines his existence. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Covetous, manipulative, and unrelenting, Amber stands as a shadow of Pinky’s soul—a collector who 
                  will never be satisfied, no matter how much he takes.

                <p>
                  Born from one of the lesser shards of Pinky’s soul, <em>Guu Lutonny</em> is the embodiment of 
                  gluttony. Unlike his stronger counterparts, he carries no desire for conquest or rivalry—only the 
                  endless urge to eat, to consume, and to fill the emptiness within. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though weak in power and timid in nature, his hunger itself is relentless. Guu can absorb almost 
                  anything he devours, breaking it down to sustain himself or twisting it into strange bursts of 
                  strength. Yet his satisfaction never lasts, for the moment his mouth is empty, the craving returns. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Simple, harmless, and ever-hungry, Guu Lutonny is a

                  Once counted among the most notorious fragments of Pinky’s soul, <em>Lust Arcadia</em> has vanished 
                  without a trace. The other fragments speak of him with awe, recalling a figure whose presence was as 
                  commanding as it was unsettling. His absence lingers like a shadow, driving the rest to search for 
                  him relentlessly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lust Arcadia’s form bears a striking resemblance to Pinky, his body glowing with the same vibrant 
                  pink. This likeness led many to mistake Pinky for him, until battle revealed the truth. Where Pinky 
                  carries innocence, Arcadia carries desire, a force that bends and binds those who fall under its sway. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alluring, dangerous, and unseen, Lust Arcadia remains a mystery. Whether his return will unite or 
                  destroy the fragments is a question none can answer.

                  force. His wrath is unending, and his fists have shaped both ruin and resolution.

                  In one legendary outburst, his overwhelming power shattered two rival kingdoms into submission,

                  Among the strangest fragments of Pinky’s soul, <em>Aergia: The Idle</em> was bestowed with the power 
                  to remain still and yet endure. Though capable of immense strength, he hides it behind endless slumber, 
                  choosing to live in quiet idleness rather than reveal the force he possesses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Known as one of the strongest entities in cosmic space, Aergia’s days are spent drifting into sleep, 
                  whether beneath a tree, within a cavern, or even in the heart of a volcano. His apathy shields him

                <p>
                  His strength rises with his conviction, each battle feeding his belief that he alone was destined to
