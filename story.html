      <h2 class="main-story-title">Prologue: The Cosmic Divergence</h2>
      <p>
        Before the age of mortals, before kingdoms marked their banners upon the stars, there was only silence. 
        From that silence, convergence gave birth to a being without precedent—<em>Pinky the Entity</em>. 
        Neither god nor mortal, neither spirit nor machine, Pinky was something in between. A spark of creation 
        so pure that it defied the measures of the cosmos itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, the cosmic gods regarded him with curiosity. He was harmless, wandering through the void with 
        a childlike wonder. Yet as the cycles turned, they saw the truth: his power was not one that grew slowly, 
        nor one that could be restrained. It was infinite. He did not need followers, nor worship. His very 
        existence bent reality, and what was once seen as innocence began to resemble inevitability.
      </p>
      <p>
        A murmur rose among the gods. Could such a being rule over them without trying? Could such power remain 
        untouched without consequence? Their fear was not of his actions, but of his potential. If one day his 
        heart strayed, if one day he desired, nothing could stand against him.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the Court of Cosmic Divergence was called. From every realm, from every domain, arbiters gathered in 
        solemn council. The verdict was not spoken with anger, nor hatred, but with trembling necessity: 
        <em>Pinky the Entity must be divided</em>. No one soul was meant to contain such boundless force. 
        To preserve the balance of existence, he would be broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        The judgment was swift. With words that shaped reality itself, the gods carved his essence apart. 
        Seven fragments were drawn from the core of his being, each born from the shadows of his heart—envy, 
        gluttony, wrath, sloth, greed, pride, and lust. They were scattered across the stars, given names, forms, 
        and wills of their own. What once had been unity became division.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the ritual ended, what remained of Pinky was hollow. His memories dissolved like smoke. His radiance 
        dimmed to a faint glimmer. He was sealed in hibernation, drifting endlessly through the void, a forgotten 
        shell of what once had been whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gods left satisfied, believing balance had been restored. To them, the danger was ended, and the 
        universe could breathe once more. Yet fragments, once born, cannot remain still. Each carried the will 
        of its sin, and in time, each would shape the cosmos in ways even the gods could not foresee.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus began the age of divergence. A story not of gods, but of fragments. A story not of endings, 
        but of a beginning that had only just taken shape.

      <h2 class="main-story-title">Chapter I: Awakening in Still Fields</h2>
      <p>
        Ages passed since the Court of Cosmic Divergence tore Pinky into fragments. The cosmos moved on, kingdoms 
        rose and fell, stars burned bright and collapsed into ash, and the fragments of his soul wandered freely, 
        shaping empires, cults, and legends in their own image. But Pinky himself lay forgotten, locked in a slumber 
        without dreams. Neither time nor tide could reach him, for he drifted in a void deeper than memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came the silence. Not the silence of sleep, but the silence that comes before breath, the whisper 
        that stirs just before something awakens. A pulse trembled in the hollow shell of his being. A spark, 
        faint yet undeniable, called him back to the world. His eyes opened for the first time in centuries, 
        and light spilled into his vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        He awoke not in the heavens nor in fire, but upon a quiet grassland. The Still Fields stretched endlessly, 
        their rolling blades of green swaying under a gentle wind. To one side, mountains rose like silent 
        guardians against the horizon. To the other, the plain stretched on forever, carrying with it the 
        emptiness of a world untouched. There was no song of birds, no voice of rivers, only the sound of the 
        wind whispering across the fields. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Pinky’s body was light, yet unfamiliar. He reached for memories, but there was nothing, no past, no origin, 
        only fragments of feeling, like shadows that slipped away as soon as he touched them. A name drifted to 
        him in the stillness, faint but certain: <em>Pinky</em>. Whether it was his true name or simply what remained, 
        he could not know. Yet he clung to it, for it was the only anchor he had.
      </p>
      <p>
        He took his first step into the grass, and the world shifted. Though he could not remember why, the land 
        itself seemed to recognize him. The wind grew heavier, the silence sharper, as if the earth and sky held 
        their breath in his presence. Somewhere deep within, he felt it, a hollow ache where something had been 
        torn away. An emptiness that should not exist. The missing fragments of himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Night fell slowly across the plains, and for the first time since his rebirth, Pinky looked upon the stars. 
        They shone brilliantly above, but there was no comfort in them. Each constellation seemed unfamiliar, 
        each star a stranger, as though the heavens themselves had changed while he slept. He realized then that 
        he was alone in a world he did not know, bound to a past he could not remember, carrying a weight he 
        could not name.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so his journey began, not with a clash of armies or a declaration of gods, but with a single step 
        taken in the Still Fields. A step into the unknown, guided only by instinct and by the faint pull 
        of something lost. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The fragments were waiting. He did not yet know them, but they would know him. And when they met again, 
        the stillness of the fields would be broken forever.
      </p>
      <h2 class="main-story-title">Chapter I: Awakening in Still Fields</h2>
      <p>
        The silence of the fields stretched endlessly, broken only by the whisper of tall grass swaying in the wind. 
        Pinky stirred, his eyes opening to a world unfamiliar and strangely quiet. The sky above shimmered with 
        colors he could not name, and mountains in the distance stood like watchers, ancient and unyielding. 
        Yet within his heart, there was nothing but emptiness. His name, his purpose, even the reason for his 
        existence had slipped away into shadows. He rose, unsteady, and began to walk.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Still Fields lived up to their name. No birds sang, no streams ran, and no other life stirred. 
        It was a world in slumber, and Pinky felt as though he had awoken in a dream that was not his own. 
        For hours he wandered, each step pulling him deeper into the quiet unknown. He searched for something 
        he could not name, as if the answers to his questions lingered just beyond his sight. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It was then that he noticed it. A pulse in the distance, faint but unyielding, as if the very air 
        throbbed with restrained power. Drawn to it, Pinky pressed forward through the grass until he found 
        a strange sight: a great sphere of energy suspended above the earth, shimmering like a mirror made 
        of starlight. Within it floated a single, colossal eye, bound by chains of light that coiled endlessly 
        around it. The eye turned slowly, as if searching, though its gaze seemed blind to the world outside. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The sight unsettled him, yet curiosity outweighed fear. Pinky reached toward the cosmic field, and as 
        his fingers brushed the edge, the sphere rippled. The energy bent and drew into him, pouring through 
        his body like rivers of fire. His chest burned as the field collapsed, unraveling into streams of 
        light that vanished into his form. When the last fragment faded, the chains shattered, and the eye 
        was free.
      </p>

      <p>
        The massive eye blinked once, its surface glowing with impossible patterns. Then, in a voice that 
        seemed to echo directly within his mind, it spoke. “So... you are the one who stirs at last. I have 
        waited in silence for ages, bound by fear of what you once were. To be freed by your hand is no 
        small irony.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Pinky recoiled slightly, unsure what he had unleashed. “Who are you?” he asked, his voice soft, 
        uncertain. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The eye’s pupil narrowed, and its gaze fixed firmly upon him. “I am called the Eye, the watcher of 
        all that is and all that was. I see truths others cannot bear, and secrets they would rather forget. 
        Now I see you, a being broken, searching for what has been taken.” Its tone carried no warmth, yet 
        its words felt certain, almost inevitable. 
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fragments of yourself lie scattered,” the Eye continued. “Each carries a piece of your power, 
        but also a piece of your sin. If you seek your past, you must face them. The first lies beyond these 
        fields, in a land poisoned by envy. Travel to the Envious Plains, and there you will find what you 
        seek... or be consumed by it.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Pinky felt no answers in those words, only more questions. Yet the certainty of the Eye pressed into 
        him like the weight of truth. He glanced back at the still fields one last time, then turned his 
        steps toward the horizon where the plains awaited. Behind him, the Eye drifted silently, following 
        with unblinking patience, as though it had always been part of his journey. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="main-story-title">Chapter II: The Plains of Envy</h2>
      <p>
        The journey from the Still Fields carried Pinky into lands where the air felt heavier, tinged with a 
        restless hunger that clung to the earth itself. The grass grew darker here, tinted in shades of 
        sickly green, and the sky above seemed dimmer, as though envious of its own light. The Eye floated 
        silently beside him, unblinking, its presence both a comfort and an unease. Pinky pressed forward, 
        driven not by memory but by the pull of something waiting just ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he entered deeper into the plains, the ground shifted into strange formations. Stones were stacked 
        into towers that defied balance, leaning upon one another in impossible ways. Ancient carvings 
        marked their surfaces, swirling patterns that pulsed faintly with energy. A puzzle, left behind as a 
        barrier, as though to test or delay him. Pinky placed his hand upon the nearest stone, and the carvings 
        flared with light, rearranging into riddles only instinct could answer. Piece by piece, he shifted the 
        towers, aligning their patterns until the plains trembled and the path ahead opened, tearing away 
        a veil of green mist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond the mist lay a figure, tall and graceful, wrapped in flowing robes that shimmered with emerald 
        light. His eyes were sharp, his presence regal, though his smile carried venom beneath its charm. 
        He looked upon Pinky with sudden recognition, and his voice rang out across the plains. 
        “Lust Arcadia... so you return at last. I knew your vanity could never keep you hidden for long.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Pinky froze. The name stirred no memory, but it weighed heavily in his mind, like a name he was meant 
        to know. “I am not who you think I am,” he answered carefully. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The figure’s smile faltered, his gaze narrowing with suspicion. “Not him? Impossible. That aura, that 
        power, it reeks of the fragments I know so well. Do not toy with me.” The green radiance surrounding 
        him sharpened, twisting into jagged forms. “You are no stranger. You are one of us.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        The plains shuddered as envy itself surged. The being called Green stepped forward, his power lashing 
        out like tendrils of jealous flame. Pinky raised his hands in defense, the force instinctively meeting 
        his own. The two clashed, their struggle shaking the land, envy seeking to overwhelm, while Pinky’s 
        unknown strength fought back with raw will. The Eye lingered behind, watching every strike, silent as 
        ever.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the height of the battle, Pinky’s power surged uncontrollably. A familiar pull tore through him, 
        and Green staggered as the energy of the plains bent toward Pinky. Envy screamed, a cry of rage and 
        desperation, before his form broke apart into streams of green light. They spiraled into Pinky, 
        merging with his body, filling the emptiness within him with both strength and sorrow. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The plains fell silent once more. The grass dimmed, the mist thinned, and the carvings on the stones 
        faded into stillness. Pinky stood motionless, shaken by what he had done. Another fragment absorbed, 
        another piece of himself reclaimed, though it left behind more questions than answers. The Eye drifted 
        closer, its voice finally breaking the silence. 
      </p>

      <p>
        “One has returned to you,” it said calmly. “But six more remain, and each will not yield so easily. 
        The path you walk grows darker with every step. Are you ready to face what waits beyond?” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Pinky looked to the horizon. Though he did not know where the next trial lay, he knew the journey had 
        only just begun. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="main-story-title">Chapter III: The Gears of Robotri</h2>
      <p>
        With Envy’s power coursing through him, Pinky felt a faint but undeniable shift within. The weight of 
        the plains had left him weary, but the fragment’s energy restored a spark he had long forgotten. 
        Shadows bent more subtly to his will, the faint hum of distant voices brushed against his mind, 
        and his movements carried a sharper purpose. Though he did not yet understand the full scope of what 
        he had reclaimed, he knew his journey was far from over. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The Eye, ever-floating beside him, whispered of the next path: the Glutton’s Den, a domain where 
        hunger itself never slept. But to reach it, they would need to cross the Forest of Mos. The very name 
        carried unease. Few wandered those woods and returned unchanged. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The forest loomed ahead, dense with towering trees whose branches interlocked like the teeth of 
        colossal gears. Moss clung to every surface, wet and luminous in the dim light that filtered through 
        the canopy. The air buzzed faintly, not with insects but with a metallic hum, as though the forest 
        itself was alive with hidden machinery. The river that ran through it glimmered an unnatural silver, 
        its currents sluggish and thick. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It was near this river that Pinky noticed something out of place: a metallic hand reaching up from 
        the mud, half-buried beneath moss and stone. He moved closer and uncovered a battered frame, 
        its once-polished armor dulled and cracked. The figure was humanoid, though its chest was split open, 
        gears exposed and unmoving. A single eye of glass stared lifelessly into the void. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Pinky pressed his palm against the machine’s chest. For a moment nothing happened, but then, 
        instinct guided him. The fragment of Green stirred within him, and energy pulsed outward in threads 
        of emerald light. The gears groaned, metal shifted, and the chest began to close as cracks sealed with 
        a faint glow. A surge of power rippled through the broken frame, and with a shudder, the machine drew 
        its first mechanical breath. 
      </p>

      <p>
        “...System... reboot... incomplete...” The voice was cold, hollow, and fractured, yet alive. The 
        machine’s single glass eye flickered with green light. Slowly, it lifted from the ground, hovering 
        clumsily above the riverbank. “Designation... unknown. Energy signature detected. Who... repairs... 
        this unit?” 
      </p>

      <p>
        “I did,” Pinky answered simply. “You were broken. I restored you.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        The Eye circled the machine warily, its unblinking gaze fixed upon the fragile new companion. The 
        robot paused as though processing, then replied in its monotone hum. “Acknowledged. Gratitude... 
        insufficient. I am... Robotri. Core functions damaged. Remaining capabilities: scan, hover, speech.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Its chest opened briefly, projecting lines of light across the forest floor. The beams bent and 
        shaped themselves into shifting maps, symbols, and fragments of data. “I can read... patterns. 
        Analyze... structures. Guide.” The voice cracked, glitching as it struggled to maintain tone. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Pinky nodded. Though barely functional, Robotri’s presence carried the potential of knowledge 
        unreachable by flesh alone. “Then you will come with us. There is more ahead, and I cannot face it 
        alone.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Robotri hovered closer, its light casting faint ripples on the silver river. “Command accepted. 
        Following... until functions cease.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, the three left the riverbank, pressing deeper into the Forest of Mos. The air grew colder, 
        the canopy darker, and the metallic hum louder, as though the forest itself watched them. With Robotri’s 
        flickering eye joining the ever-watchful gaze of the Eye, Pinky felt both guarded and unsettled. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The path to the Glutton’s Den had begun, and though the shadows of the forest pressed in from every 
        side, he carried forward with two companions — one of mystery, and one of steel. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="main-story-title">Chapter IV: The Glutton's Den</h2>
      <p>
        The Forest of Mos thinned as the trio pressed forward, its silver river breaking into streams that 
        twisted and coiled like veins beneath the earth. Beyond the last line of moss-covered trees, a 
        chasm yawned before them. From its depths rose a sound — not wind, not water, but the endless 
        gnashing of teeth. The air was thick with a scent both sweet and rancid, a stench of rotting feasts 
        long devoured. This was the threshold. This was the Glutton’s Den. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The Eye drifted closer to the void, unblinking. “Here, the fragment of Gluttony waits. Beware, Pinky. 
        Hunger takes many shapes, and those who enter seldom leave unconsumed.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Robotri’s single lens whirred, projecting thin beams across the cavern walls. “Warning... structural 
        instability detected. Organic remains... ninety-eight percent match to humanoid lifeforms. 
        Probability of predation: high.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Pinky stood at the edge and felt his chest tighten. The Den called to him, whispering cravings not 
        his own. It was not food he desired, but something deeper — the insatiable need to fill emptiness. 
        He clenched his fists and stepped inside. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The cavern walls shimmered with fleshy growths, pulsing faintly like organs half-awake. 
        Bones crunched beneath their steps, some small, some larger than any creature should be. 
        Strange puzzles of stone and bone blocked their path: doorways sealed with gaping mouths, 
        each demanding tribute before opening. Pinky touched one of the doors and felt a pull at his essence, 
        as though the Den itself demanded a piece of him. Instead, he focused the power of Envy and Green’s 
        fragment pulsed, allowing him to twist the pull into release. The mouths opened reluctantly, 
        shrinking back into the walls with a sickening hiss.

      <p>
        Deeper they went, until the cavern opened into a hall vast and terrible. At its center sat a mass of 
        flesh and machinery fused together, a grotesque throne of bones piled high. Upon it slouched a 
        colossal figure, his belly swollen, his jaws lined with endless teeth. His arms, thick as trees, 
        dragged lazily across the floor as he leaned forward. Eyes opened along his gut, all of them focused 
        hungrily on Pinky. 
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lust... Arcadia...” The voice thundered through the chamber, wet and gluttonous. “You return to feed me again?” 
      </p>

      <p>
        “I am not who you think I am,” Pinky said firmly, though his voice wavered under the weight of the 
        giant’s presence. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The figure bellowed laughter, a grotesque rumble that shook the cavern. “No matter! 
        If you are not Lust, then you shall be my meal. Hunger cares not for names.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        The monster lurched forward. Its name carried itself through the darkness as though whispered by 
        the cavern itself: Guu Lutonny, the Devourer. He swung his massive arms, each strike cratering 
        the stone floor. Pinky darted aside, his movements sharper now with Envy’s fragment empowering him. 
        Robotri projected scans across the battlefield, highlighting weak joints and unstable ground. 
        “The core... beneath abdominal cavity. Strike... when exposed.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        The Eye hovered above, silent and still, its gaze never leaving the clash. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Guu roared, his mouth gaping wide to swallow Pinky whole. But Pinky leapt high, landing upon 
        the giant’s shoulder. Energy surged through him as he drove his fist into the bloated flesh. 
        The fragment within his chest pulsed, burning away the corruption. Guu screamed, thrashing wildly, 
        slamming himself into walls to shake Pinky loose. Stone collapsed, dust choking the air, but Pinky 
        held on, clawing his way toward the glowing heart beneath the folds of flesh. 
      </p>

      <p>
        With a final strike, he plunged his hand into the core. A burst of green and crimson light erupted 
        from within, and Guu howled as his form unraveled. His mass collapsed inward, shrinking into a 
        single shard of luminous essence. Pinky staggered back, the shard hovering before him, pulsing with 
        hunger unfulfilled. Slowly, it sank into his chest. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Silence filled the cavern. The Den shuddered, no longer alive but hollow, a corpse of stone. 
        Robotri lowered beside him, scanning. “Threat... neutralized. Fragment absorbed. Power... increasing.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        The Eye finally spoke. “Two fragments now dwell within you. But beware, Pinky. With each one you 
        consume, the line between strength and corruption blurs. Do not mistake hunger for destiny.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Pinky breathed heavily, gazing into the fading darkness where Guu once sat. His journey was only 
        growing heavier, but he pressed forward. There were more fragments ahead, and he would need them all 
        if he was ever to reclaim who he once was.
